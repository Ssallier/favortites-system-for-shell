To use our program: download the file projetsallier.sh and execute the command source projetsallier.sh if you are in the directory where the file is located; otherwise, run it in the form source /pathtodirectorycontainingthefileprojetsallier.sh.

Once the source command is used, you can use the 4 functions from any directory, as the program will create a hidden folder containing the shortcuts.
Four functions are available:

S - Save a shortcut/favorite.
C - Move to a shortcut.
R - Delete a shortcut.
L - Display the list of shortcuts.
To use the functions S, C, and R, you must provide a shortcut name as a parameter, or you will receive an error message.
